# ![app icon](./.forgejo/readme-images/app-icon.png) Aniyomi Extensions (Français)

This repository contains extensions for the [Aniyomi](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi) application.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Aniyomi app.
They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.
<!--
## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via https://aniyomi.org/extensions/ or directly in
this repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).
-->

# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation
for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.
